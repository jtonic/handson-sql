## This project is for learning purposes.

The more ORM frameworks gains in popularity the more SQL knowledge fades out.

So, I decided to re-gain my SQL ANSI knowledge and even go further and learn new features in SQL ANSI, say **with** clause.


#### Tasks:
1. with clause
1. join clause
1. exists
1. group by ... having and aggregate functions
1. built-in functions
1. stored procedure
1. exceptions

#### Initially the sql commands and tests will be tested against Oracle RDBMS (sqlplus command line).
